## 🌟 Project Summary

**Aura Auction** is an AI-powered online auction marketplace built for high-value, rare, and collectible items. From listing generation to buyer-agent negotiation and scam prevention — everything is automated with cutting-edge AI agents and trust systems.

Inspired by a simple question:  
**_“What if eBay had a brain?”_**

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Sellers** upload product images → AI creates the listing  
2. **Buyers** describe what they want → AI curates recommendations  
3. Each listing includes an **Aura Report** for trust & authenticity  
4. **AI agents** handle negotiation, pricing, and escrow logic  
5. Users can enter **live auctions** and let agents auto-bid
